# An incomplete manifesto for a humane company

I decided to draft up a wholly incomplete (work in progress) manifesto for what it means to run a humane company, as more of a thought experiment than anything else.

### Do no unnecessary harm
Create profit and value in a way that doesn’t create victims through actions, words, practices or policies.

> Ex: Generate revenue from people who can afford your services (and don’t prey on those who can’t)

### Be a data-fiduciary
Any/all data you collect should be explained in simple terms, only collected when needed, and held in the highest regard in terms of safe-keeping.

> Ex: Don’t collect personal information so you can sell it later to generate profit.

### Practice h2h
Companies themselves aren’t people, therefore they can’t be humane. But the people running them can be, and they should treat their audiences and customers with respect, human to human.

> Ex: Be of service to customers, not exploitive of customers.

### Everything is connected
People, planet, profits. Triple-bottom-lines are the only ledger that makes sense long-term, since nothing else is ultimately sustainable.

> Ex: A business’ practice can’t be humane if they negatively impact the environment to increase profits.

### Move slow and don’t break things
Every decision has a repercussion, so move at a pace that carefully considers the consequences of actions and decisions made.

> Ex: It’s so hard to not just point at Facebook here and say “don’t act like them”.

### Learn, empathize, adapt
People, even those running companies, are imperfect and have unconscious biases. So in the event of being wrong (which will happen), learn from it, understand it, and adapt for the future.

> Ex: Don’t hide behind legalese or corporate-speak when you make a mistake. Own it, fix it, do better next time.

### Dollars are votes
Just like consumers vote with their wallets, businesses do to in terms of who they partner with, work with, and spend money with. Only support other businesses that have values that align.

> Ex: If you support data privacy, don’t advertise on Facebook or Google.

### Be grateful/optimistic

Having hope frames problems as solvable and leads to change through action. Which is companies should do (solve problems for their customers). The opposite leads to complaining without action or change.

> Ex: “That’s just how business works” isn’t a path forward towards being more humane.

### Be of service

Business is about service, providing value for the service a customer pays for. Service isn’t extractive or exploitive of customers, employees or partners.

> Ex: Pay fair wages, charge fair prices.
